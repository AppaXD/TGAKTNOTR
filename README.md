# TGAKTNOTR
TGAKTNOTR (The Game about Killing the Ninja on the Right). My first Ludum Dare 40 Submission.

It's all in one file (because I like to do stuff in one file) so it's just a huge jumbled mess. Don't learn anything from this, probably a ton of bad code and practices.

I started commenting on what I was doing but I got bored. I didn't have enough time to make a restart button so you have to re-open it every time...
